Phoplay is a simple audio player written in Python3 and uses the PyQt4 Phonon
library to provide playback facilities.

It can be invoked as a GUI (default) or from the commandline with or without
the GUI functionality.

INSTALLATION
Running the ./build.sh script will build the QtDesigner resource file and 
UI for the application generated from the QtDesigner .ui file.  If ./build.sh
fails then check that you have PyQt4 installed and the pyrcc4 and py3uic4 are
installed (they may have different names under different Linux distributions)

RUNNING
A full list of commandline options can seen by invoking the application with
the -h option.

Examples
PhoPlay.py - Lauch the GUI
PhoPlay.py - something.flac - Launch GUI and play something.flac
PhoPlay.py -x something.mp3 - Play something.mp3 from the commandline - no GUI

for *.mp3; do PhoPlay.py -q $tune; done; - Play all mp3s re-launching the
application each time.  Useful for playing a album in a folder.
